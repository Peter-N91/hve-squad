# Entry Schemas

The shapes the Squad Scribe writes on an ordinary turn. These are separate from [seed-templates.md](seed-templates.md), which stamps `team.md` and `routing.md` once during Init: every file below is written or appended to repeatedly for the life of a squad, so the Scribe reads this file on every turn while it reads the seed templates only when it is actually seeding.

Write semantics follow the state layout: `decisions.md`, `history/<agent>.md`, `history/autonomous-loop-<id>.md`, `history/autopilot-run-<id>.md`, and `notifications.md` are append-only; `state.json` uses replace semantics.

## decisions.md

Append-only log. The header is written once; every decision is appended below it and prior entries are never edited. Council Verdicts (from the Council Procedure) use the same append-only contract but a fixed schema; the placeholder below shows the shape the Scribe stamps in.

```markdown

description: "Append-only log of squad decisions and their rationale"
---

# Squad Decisions

Entries are appended below in chronological order. Each entry records the decision, its rationale, the turn it was made on, and a reference to an ADR when the decision is architecturally significant. Council Verdicts use the `## Council Verdict <timestamp> <topic-id>` heading and the schema in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-council.instructions.md`; Discovery Verdicts and Intake Readiness Verdicts use their own headings and schemas from `.github/instructions/squad/squad-discovery-gate.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/squad/squad-intake-gate.instructions.md`. Prior entries are never edited or removed.

<!--
Council Verdict placeholder (Scribe stamps this shape when a council runs):

## Council Verdict <timestamp> <topic-id>

* Topic: <one-line summary of the proposal>
* Proposal Ref: <path-to-plan-or-design>
* Council Members Dispatched: architect, security, cost-manager, product-owner
* Verdict: Go | Go-With-Conditions | Stop

### Findings by Role

| Role          | Verdict | Risk        | Blocking Issues | Conditions | Suggested Follow-ups |
|---------------|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|----------------------|
| architect     | <label> | <risk>      | <list-or-none>  | <list>     | <list>               |
| security      | <label> | <risk>      | <list-or-none>  | <list>     | <list>               |

| product-owner | <label> | <risk>      | <list-or-none>  | <list>     | <list>               |

### Synthesis

* Blocking Issues: <consolidated list with role attribution; empty when verdict is Go>
* Conditions: <consolidated list with role attribution; empty when verdict is Go>
* Suggested Follow-ups: <consolidated list with role attribution>

### Implementation Gate

* Permits Implementation Dispatch: yes (Go, Go-With-Conditions) | no (Stop)
* Conditions Outstanding: <count>

<!--
Intake Readiness Verdict placeholder (Scribe stamps this shape when the intake gate runs):

## Intake Readiness Verdict <timestamp> <topic-id>

* Topic: <one-line summary of the work the inputs ground>
* Inputs Reviewed: <comma-separated artifact paths or references>
* Validator Dispatched: <resolved agent name>
* Verdict: Ready | Ready-With-Gaps | Not-Ready
* Remediation Cycles: <0, 1, or 2>

### Findings

| Dimension        | Result    | Blocking Gaps  | Non-Blocking Gaps |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Completeness     | pass/fail | <list-or-none> | <list-or-none>    |
| Clarity          | pass/fail | <list-or-none> | <list-or-none>    |
| Testability      | pass/fail | <list-or-none> | <list-or-none>    |
| Consistency      | pass/fail | <list-or-none> | <list-or-none>    |
| Scope Boundaries | pass/fail | <list-or-none> | <list-or-none>    |

### Clarifying Questions

* <question for the user; empty when verdict is Ready>

### Recorded Assumptions

### Intake Gate

* Permits Downstream Dispatch: yes (Ready, Ready-With-Gaps) | no (Not-Ready)
* Blocking Gaps Outstanding: <count>
-->
```

## history/<agent>.md

One append-only file per dispatched agent. Replace `<agent>` with the dispatched agent's name (for example, `history/Squad Researcher.md`). The header is created with the file; dispatch records are appended. Autonomous-loop runs add per-cycle dispatch entries to each role's history file using the placeholder shape below.

```markdown
---
description: "Append-only dispatch history for a single squad agent"
---

# History: <agent>

Each entry records a request this agent handled, the findings or outcome it returned, and the turn it was dispatched on. Entries are appended in chronological order and never edited.

<!-- Append new dispatch entries below this line. -->

<!--
Autonomous-loop dispatch entry pattern (Scribe stamps this shape when mode=autonomous is in effect):

### <timestamp> autonomous-loop:<topic-id> cycle:<1|2>

* Request: <scoped request the agent received>
* Verdict Returned: <label> (Risk: <level>)
* Blocking Issues: <list-or-none>
* Conditions: <list-or-none>
* Outcome: <one-line summary>
* See: `.copilot-tracking/squad/history/autonomous-loop-<topic-id>.md`
-->
```

## history/autonomous-loop-<id>.md

One file per autonomous-loop topic. Append-only by topic-id: subsequent runs against the same topic append a new dated `## Iterations` section rather than overwriting. The Scribe writes this file only when the coordinator runs in `mode=autonomous`.

```markdown
---
description: "Autonomous-loop summary for topic <id>"
---

# Autonomous Loop: <id>

* Topic: <one-line summary>
* Opt-In: mode=autonomous
* Cost Ceiling: <value or unset>
* Outcome: converged (Go) | converged (Go-With-Conditions) | escalated (<reason>)

## Iterations

| Cycle | Verdict                        | Blocking Issues | Conditions     | Notes                    |
|-------|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 1     | Go / Go-With-Conditions / Stop | <list-or-none>  | <list-or-none> | <one-line cycle summary> |
| 2     | (when run)                     | <list-or-none>  | <list-or-none> | <one-line cycle summary> |

## Final Verdict Reference

* Council Verdict: see `decisions.md` under `## Council Verdict <timestamp> <id>`
```

## history/autopilot-run-<id>.md

One file per autopilot run. Append-only by topic-id: subsequent runs against the same topic append a new dated `## Stages` section rather than overwriting. The Scribe writes this file only when the coordinator runs in `mode=autopilot`.

```markdown
---
description: "Autopilot-run summary for topic <id>"
---

# Autopilot Run: <id>

* Topic: <one-line summary>
* Opt-In: mode=autopilot
* Cost Ceiling: <value or unset>
* Outcome: completed (awaiting final validation) | escalated (<reason>) | stopped (<reason>)

## Stages

| Stage     | Role(s)     | Result                          | Gate Fired                 |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| research  | <agent(s)>  | <one-line outcome>              | none                       |
| plan      | <agent>     | <one-line outcome>              | none                       |
| council   | <roles>     | <verdict-or-skipped>            | <none or Risk Gate reason> |
| implement | <agent>     | <one-line outcome>              | <none or Impactful-Action> |
| review    | <agent>     | <one-line outcome>              | none                       |
| final     | coordinator | notified <recipient-or-in-chat> | Final-Outcome Validation   |
```

In a deliverable fan-out run (the `product` profile), the single `implement` row expands into one row per deliverable (`implement: <deliverable>` with its owning agent).

## notifications.md

Append-only log of notifications (pings) the squad fired. The header is written once; every notification is appended below it. Records the trigger, the recipient, the resolved channel, and the decision awaited.

```markdown
---
description: "Append-only log of squad notifications (pings) and their delivery channel"
---

# Squad Notifications

Each entry records a notification the squad fired: when, to whom, the trigger, the channel it resolved to, and the decision awaited. Entries are appended in chronological order and never edited.

<!-- Append new notification entries below this line. -->
```

## state.json

Machine-readable squad status. Uses replace semantics — the coordinator overwrites it (through the Squad Scribe) as the squad advances.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.3",
  "updated": "",
  "turn": 0,
  "mode": "interactive",
  "activeRoles": [],
  "openEscalations": [],
  "currentRun": {
    "sessionModel": "",
    "modelOverrides": {},
    "estCostUsd": 0,
    "estCreditsTotal": 0
  },
  "notify": {
    "approvalChannel": "in-chat",
    "enabled": false,
    "email": "",
    "github": {
      "handle": "",
      "repo": ""
    }
  }
}
```

Watch Mode runs additionally carry an optional, additive `trigger` object recording the event that started the run; interactive, autonomous, and autopilot runs omit it. See `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`.
